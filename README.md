Help you come back to your work when the command you are waiting for is done. With an elegant ding sound ü§åüõé - made by [Nemo](https://twitter.com/phamhuyphat).

Works for both MacOs and Ubuntu.

This helps you:
- Proactively wait on the command while attending other stuff (watch a cat video while waiting)
- Avoid being distracted for too long (watch too much cat videos while waiting)

If you find this useful, please consider donating to support my work. Lots of love üôè
